### Ya, making this open source. Moving off development branch for this commit; master will be the 'main' branch where we build releases and do CI. You should be able to pull from master with a tagged version in the future

### Also, I'm not committing my Google Translate creds for obvious reasons so these tests won't work for you

## So what is this?
This is the backend for a translation app I'm making. I've been struggling to really memorize words that I would enter into Google translate so this is an app where you can tag certain translations and practice them later on (with flashcards? idk)
